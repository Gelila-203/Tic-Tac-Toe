# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple web based game. I created this game using HTML,CSS and java Script language.
It is a two player game. The first player is set to be O and the second player is X. The game has a featire of chaking the tile is empty or not before allowing to write in to the tile. If the game ends with a win it dispaly a winner and prompt to reset and play again.It also notofy if the game is drawn.
